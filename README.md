Project Description

Farm to Table is a web-based platform that connects farmers directly with consumers, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair pricing. The platform allows farmers to list their fresh produce while consumers can browse, purchase, and arrange for delivery or pickup. This enhances the farm-to-table movement, promoting sustainability and reducing food wastage.

The Problem Statement

Many farmers struggle to connect directly with consumers, leading to food wastage, low profit margins, and increased dependency on middlemen. Consumers, on the other hand, lack access to fresh, organic produce directly from farms at fair prices.

The Solution

We have developed a website that bridges the gap between farmers and consumers. Our platform enables farmers to list their fresh produce for direct sales while allowing consumers to browse and purchase items conveniently. This ensures fair pricing, reduces wastage, and promotes farm-to-table sustainability.
